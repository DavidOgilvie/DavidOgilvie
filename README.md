- 👋 Hi, I’m @DavidOgilvie
- 👀 I’m interested in improving accessibility in the Open Watcom 2.0 IDE.  As a person who has vision impairments and uses the Windows "High Contrast Black" colour scheme, I find the IDE almost unuseable as a lot of the text shows up as black text on a black background.  I think I know how to fix this... I just need to find the right place to put the code.
- 🌱 I’ve had extensive experience programming in C, and am hoping to get more familiar with C++.  Since I am now retired, I have the time to work on this project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the Open Watcom 2.0 project.
- 📫 I can be reached at d2ogilvi@hotmail.com.
